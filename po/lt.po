"In the year 164YW, assisted by the High Council of Archmagi, the grand army "
"of the kingdom of Wesnoth defeated the last foes operating openly inside the "
"country's borders. The land became much safer, and prosperity quickly rose.\n"
"A fortress was built at Halstead, in the very heart of the western "

"In some cases, the king had bought a rough-and-ready peace by granting "
"estates and titles to the warlords controlling particular areas. Some "
"warlords took advantage of the king's generosity to gain a title and "
"legitimacy, then simply continued much as they had done before. One such "
"troublemaker was known as Baron Baldres, who is oppressive and base. With "
"the defeat of the last of his overt adversaries, the king immediately turned "
"his attention to imposing order upon the more disreputable members of his "
"nobility, and it was never his intention to treat these renegades gently."

"For his part, if Baldres could not be the ruler, he would rather die than be "
"one of the ruled. So while the king imposed order elsewhere he tried to "
"enrich himself as much as possible, and made ready to escape as soon as the "
"king's men turned their attention to him. Rumors of his great wealth "
"attracted many people, including brown-noses, brigands, and other hangers-"
"on. Rumors that he planned to escape the kingdom from under the very spears "
"of the king's army attracted fugitives, rogue mages and other dissidents who "
"did not wish to live under the banner of Wesnoth. When the first of the "
"king's advance scouts appeared, Baron Baldres was ready to depart."

"A baby girl, Alingwen, was born to Queen Melindë and grew up in Rowandel "
"with her three-years-older half sister Eämeral. Alingwen, however, was a bit "

"excelled in prediction and healing, Alingwen was crafty, adept at elvish "
"martial arts, and powerful. By the age of ten, she had mastered most of "
"elvish martial arts, and even Elen-Garil was sometimes almost beaten during "
"training sessions with her. The girl, in fact, spent much of her time in the "
"company of swordmaster Elan-Garil, who treated her with far greater kindness "

"the Duke easily persuaded himself that it would be best to assign the girl's "
"upbringing to a human tutor. A powerful wizard known as Gulcyn was chosen "
"and invited at Rowandel. Although his elven wife, Fioniel, from Misty Forest "
"rejected to be entrusted with Baldres's daughter, Gulcyn accepted it "
"willingly. At the age of eleven, Alingwen had to leave her mother, her half-"
