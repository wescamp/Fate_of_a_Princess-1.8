    description= _ "Savage and warlike southern orcs form the backbone of the Barbarian hordes.

Orcish society is ill-suited to large-scale warfare, which leaves their small tribes at prey to the more organised might of the world's various armies. However in the last two centuries something has changed. Orcs now fight with Cyclops, Trolls, Rocs and goblins side by side whether it be in brutal hunting packs or full blown armies. The origins of this change are unknown but one thing is sure, when the barbarian hordes come screaming for your blood the Orcs will be leading the charge."
